# Left Click to Explode
This is a mod for Derail Valley that allows users to easily explode and unexplode locomotives.

I made it to help troubleshoot a different mod, and figured others could use it.

You can use the comms radio to explode locomotives, or to unexplode locomotives that have already exploded.
